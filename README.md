# Minesweeper in C with SDL2

Just a side project to learn more SDL2, and because I like minesweeper.
I'm basing it off of [Minesweeper - The Clean One](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ee.dustland.android.minesweeper).

- [ ] Cache textures/fonts
- [X] Reduce VRAM usage (~35% with 8GB, wtf)
